L.A. Crime Scene Investigation: Data-Driven Detectives

# Research Topic: - 
The city of Los Angeles faces ongoing challenges in understanding and addressing the complexity of crime across its diverse neighborhoods. With thousands of recorded incidents varying by crime type, victim demographics, location, and modus operandi, law enforcement and city officials require deeper insights into the patterns and factors driving crime in specific areas.

The dataset includes detailed information on reported crimes such as crime codes, descriptions, victim age, sex, and descent, as well as crime locations, types of weapons used, and case statuses. However, identifying meaningful trends and correlations—such as how crime types vary by location, how victim demographics relate to specific crimes, and how different weapons are used in different crimes—remains a critical challenge.
Focus on Crime Analysis in Los Angeles from 2020 to present using a dataset containing detailed information on crime incidents.

# SMART Question: - 
1. Which neighborhoods in Los Angeles have experienced the most significant increases in crime rates from 2020 to the present, and are these trends consistent for the same types of crimes year over year?
2. How have theft, robbery, and homicide rates in Los Angeles changed from 2020 to the present, and which of these categories shows the highest overall density of crime during this time?
3. How does the type or frequency of crimes in Los Angeles vary by victim descent, and are there significant geographic patterns (based on latitude and longitude) associated with specific victim groups?
4. Which type of crime in Los Angeles is most frequently associated with weapon use, and what specific types of weapons are most commonly involved in those incidents over the last 2 years?
5. How have the top three most common crimes from 2020 to the present been distributed across the top five areas where they are most frequently committed in Los Angeles, and are these trends increasing or decreasing in each area from 2020 to 2024?

# Dataset Information: - 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

The dataset includes detailed information on reported crimes from 2020 to the present, with approximately 950,000 rows and 28 columns. Key details include:
1. Crime types
2. Locations
3. Dates
4. Demographic data of involved individuals. etc

The dataset includes detailed fields such as crime status (whether the case is open, under investigation, or closed), types of weapons used, and multiple crime codes for incidents involving more than one criminal offense. This allows for deeper analysis of crime severity and resolution rates.
