**SMART QUESTIONS**

1) Which neighborhoods in Los Angeles have experienced the most significant increases in crime rates from 2020 to the present, and are these trends consistent for the same types of crimes year over year?
2) How have theft, robbery, and homicide rates in Los Angeles changed from 2020 to the present, and which of these categories shows the highest overall density of crime during this time?
3) How does the type or frequency of crimes in Los Angeles vary by victim descent, and are there significant geographic patterns (based on latitude and longitude) associated with specific victim groups?
4) Which crimes in Los Angeles exhibited the highest weapon usage, and which ethnicities and genders showed the most significant weapon involvement over the last five years?
5) How have the top three most common crimes from 2020 to the present been distributed across the top five areas where they are most frequently committed in Los Angeles, and are these trends increasing or decreasing in each area from 2020 to 2024?


```{r}
crime = read.csv("Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv")
head(crime)
```

```{r}

  2. Notable but Not Significant:

Year-over-Year Trends by Crime Type:
  # Battery - Simple Assault:
    # - Peak increases in 2021-2022
    # - Central area showed highest variability
    # - Hollywood shows declining trend in 2023

  # Theft of Identity:
    # - Dramatic spike in 2022 (>200% in some areas)
    # - Consistent decline in 2023 across all areas
    # - 77th Street shows most stable pattern

  # Vehicle - Stolen:
    # - Central area shows persistent increase
    # - Most areas peak in 2021-2022
    # - Varying patterns of decline in 2023


Key Findings for Policy:
  # - Crime type is stronger predictor than location
  # - 2022 was peak year for most crime types
  # - Different crimes show distinct geographic patterns

Seasonal Trends: The first plot, displaying monthly crime trends by year, shows distinct seasonal fluctuations. Typically, crime rates appear to increase during certain months, which might correlate with seasonal activities or societal patterns. Identifying these peaks can help in planning better law enforcement deployment during high-risk times.

Top Crimes During Holidays: The list and plot of top crime types during November and December for each year reveal that certain types of crimes, such as vehicle theft, burglary, and assault, consistently rank high during the holiday seasons. This pattern suggests a need for targeted preventive measures during these periods when specific crimes spike, possibly due to the increased opportunity (with many homes potentially left empty and more retail activity).

Visual Accessibility: The bar chart displaying top 20 crime types during the holidays uses a horizontal layout, making it easier to read and compare the frequency of different crimes. This visualization helps stakeholders quickly identify the most prevalent crimes during the holiday seasons, which could inform public awareness campaigns and policing strategies.

Detailed Examination: The detailed breakdown by crime type, year, and month provides a granular view of crime trends, offering insights not only into the ‘what’ and ‘when’ but potentially the ‘why’ of crime patterns. For instance, understanding that thefts increase during November and December could be linked to the higher volume of shopping and unattended properties during the holiday season.

Analysis
1) Hand Gun usage is notably higher for Black (B) and Hispanic (H) victims, with males being disproportionately represented. Strong Arm (physical force) incidents are more frequent for White (W) victims, with a balanced representation of both male and female victims.

2) Across all categories, males (teal) are more frequently victims, especially in cases involving firearms.
Female victims (red) appear more frequently in non-weapon-based incidents such as Strong Arm cases (e.g., assaults).

3) Hispanic (H) victims have a high rate of gun-related incidents involving male victims. White (W) victims show a high count for Strong Arm incidents, with females almost matching male victims. Other (O) group mainly experiences incidents involving Strong Arm, with no significant firearm usage.

4) This visualization suggests that firearms are predominantly involved in incidents affecting Black and Hispanic males. Meanwhile, physical force is more common among White victims. Gender-based victimization patterns are also evident, with men more frequently involved in firearm-related incidents, whereas women are more often victims in physical confrontations.

Analysis:

Males:
1) For several ethnic groups, males are involved in the majority of crimes compared to females. Black and Hispanic/Latino/Mexican groups exhibit the highest crime counts, indicated by darker shades.

Females:
1) Crimes against females appear less frequent overall, with relatively lighter shades. However, there is still notable representation among Black and Hispanic/Latino/Mexican victims, though to a lesser extent than males.

Unknown/Other Sex (X):
1) This category has significant counts across several ethnicities, particularly Black, Hispanic/Latino/Mexican, and White groups.     

White victims also show a high frequency but with a more balanced sex distribution compared to other ethnic groups.
Asian and Pacific Islander groups generally exhibit lower crime counts, as indicated by the lighter shades.

The gender distribution also shows that males are disproportionately affected across most ethnic groups, especially in the most impacted categories.

```{r}
#Test for Independence
contingency_Sex <- table(la_crime$Victim_Sex, la_crime$Crime_Description)

contingency_descent <- table(la_crime$Victim_Descent, la_crime$Crime_Description)
```

```{r}
chi_squared_result <- chisq.test(contingency_Sex)
print(chi_squared_result)
```
```{r}
chi_squared_result1 <- chisq.test(contingency_descent)
print(chi_squared_result1)
```
There is a statistically significant association between the two categorical variables for both tests conducted between Victim Sex, Descent and Crime. Hence we can accept the alternate hypothesis that they are dependent on each other.
